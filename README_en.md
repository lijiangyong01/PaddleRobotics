# PaddleRobotics
paddleRobotics is an open source algorithm library for robots based on paddle, including open source parts such as human-computer interaction, complex motion control, environment perception, slam positioning and navigation.

## Human–Machine Interaction 
#### Multi-mode Interaction 
multi-mode interaction technology uses vision, voice, touch sensors and other input robots to make decisions and output responses such as expressions, actions, and sounds.
* [TFVT-HRI](HRI/TFVF_HRI/README.md)

## Complex Motion Control
#### Quadruped robot motion control 
Through reinforcement learning, the four-legged robot can walk, avoid obstacles, and overcome obstacles.
## Environmental Perception
Through the vision, radar, ultrasonic, infrared and other sensors to obtain the current environmental information in real time, data fusion processing, accurate judgment of environmental status.

## Slam Positioning Navigation
Through the perception of environmental information, the current passable area judgment and multi-target tracking are realized after algorithm processing.
